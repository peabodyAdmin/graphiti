# Edge Primacy Documentation Update Plan

## Overview
This directory contains phased, self-contained tasks to convert property-based pointers to graph edges across the six Aiden docs. Each phase targets one file and includes all necessary context, edge references, edits, validation, and sequencing.

## Phase Files (execution order)
1. `phase1-foundation.md` — 00-foundation.md
2. `phase2-business-rules.md` — 01-business_rules.md
3. `phase3-architecture.md` — 02-archtecture.md
4. `phase4-endpoint-classification.md` — 03-endpoint-classification.md
5. `phase5-async-api.md` — 04-async-api.md
6. `phase6-openapi.md` — 05-openapi.md

## Execution Order
- Complete phases in order (1→6). Dependencies are noted in each file.
- After all phases, run `validation-checklist.md`.

## Progress Tracking Template
- Mark edits and validations with `[x]` when complete.
- Mark phase complete at the end of each file: `- [ ] Phase N complete`.
